## The Advice You Hear Doesn’t Apply To Everyone

Popular advice isn’t always true. Take every single piece of advice you hear with a grain of salt. <u>I don’t care how credible the person delivering the advice – they could be a CS bootcamp grad or a Principal Engineer at Google. In fact, this credibility might go against them.</u>

Yes, it is true that anyone can give good advice. Joseph Stalin famously said, “_I believe in one thing only, the power of human will._” Would it be so bad for you to agree with that quote in a vacuum? Perhaps not, but context **does** exist and matters.

### Let me apply this idea more specifically to tech. I will focus on advice pertaining to job hunting, since that’s what I’m currently focusing on. Then, I'll debunk some common advice for new grads that makes me roll my eyes. 

Let’s say that you’re someone who is early in your career (either a college student or someone who hasn’t been working in the industry for too long) and you are looking to find a brand new job.

If you go to a non-target school, like say, Oregon State University, then much of the advice you get from a student who goes to a target school will not apply to you. For someone who goes to a target school like MIT, Stanford, UIUC, Georgia Tech, UC Berkley, etc., they will have far more opportunities with career fairs, networking, and recruiting than you will. For a simple example, I’ve seen job postings that are only targeted for certain colleges, like this job listing for Uber:

Of course, there are other unsaid advantages. If you go to a target school, your resume is far more likely to pass through ATS systems and be seen by an actual human (but I digress – I will talk more about pedigree in another post in this series later).

The people at these target schools might literally not be aware of your circumstances. It’s not exactly their fault for giving “incorrect” advice, it’s just advice that doesn’t apply to you.

The same thing holds true for engineers in industry. Just because they’ve have experience and you don’t, it doesn’t mean their advice will work for you. In fact, the more experienced someone is, the more likely it is that their advice won’t apply to you.

I'll use a story to explain this, but it's pretty much the same principle as before.

Last year, I had an interview with Broadcom for an embedded software engineer. This was the worst interview experience of my life (it's not even close), but perhaps I'll talk about that another day. Anyway, one thing that was unique about this was the way it was conducted. After the initial screening, I had to fly to Colorado and do a grueling 8-hours long onsite process. 

When I got there, I was greeted by the same engineer who initially screened me. He actually drove me from my hotel to the office (again, long story) for the onsite. We were making some small talk, and he asked me if I had interviewed at any other places.

"Yeah, I interviewed for a role at Apple a few months back," I responded.

"Oh, that's good" he said. "Did you also go there for the onsite interview process? It's in Cupertino, right?"

"No, I didn't have to go in for an onsite," I replied, a bit confused. "I just applied online and the interview was entirely online."

"Oh," he said, "that's unusual. Most people have to go in for an onsite."

I remembered that I had looked at this guy's LinkedIn before at some point. I remembered that he had been working at the same company for **nearly 25 years straight.** 

Even though he had a library's worth of knowledge on me and quite literally an entire lifetime (his YOE exceeds my entire lifespan), he was completely out of touch with the current state of the tech industry. He probably hadn't interviewed in years. Why would he? He was making a fortune with Broadcom's stock appreciation. He probably couldn't get the same level of pay anywhere else, even if he wanted to.

Thus, almost all of his advice was irrelevant for me. Some of it applied. But the vast majority was useless.

### By the same token, trusting too much in someone's ethos can be harmful by making you go down the wrong path.

## Debunking Common Advice for New Grad Software Engineers

### 1. "Just build projects!"

This is probably the most common piece of advice you'll hear, and while it's not entirely wrong, it's often misleading.
