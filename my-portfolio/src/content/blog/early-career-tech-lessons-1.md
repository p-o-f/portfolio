## The Advice You Hear Doesn’t Apply To Everyone

Popular advice isn’t always true. Take every single piece of advice you hear with a grain of salt. <u>I don’t care how credible the person delivering the advice – they could be a CS bootcamp grad or a Principal Engineer at Google. In fact, this credibility might go against them.</u>

Yes, it is true that anyone can give good advice. Joseph Stalin famously said, “_I believe in one thing only, the power of human will._” Would it be so bad for you to agree with that quote in a vacuum? Perhaps not, but context **does** exist and matters.

Let me apply this idea more specifically to tech. I will focus on advice pertaining to job hunting, since that’s what I’m currently focusing on.

Let’s say that you’re someone who is early in your career (either a college student or someone who hasn’t been working in the industry for too long) and you are looking to find a brand new job.

If you go to a non-target school, like say, Oregon State University, then much of the advice you get from a student who goes to a target school will not apply to you. For someone who goes to a target school like MIT, Stanford, UIUC, Georgia Tech, UC Berkley, etc., they will have far more opportunities with career fairs, networking, and recruiting than you will. For a simple example, I’ve seen job postings that are only targeted for certain colleges, like this job listing for Uber:

Of course, there are other unsaid advantages. If you go to a target school, your resume is far more likely to pass through ATS systems and be seen by an actual human.

The people at these target schools might literally not be aware of your circumstances. It’s not exactly their fault for giving “incorrect” advice, it’s just advice that doesn’t apply to you.
