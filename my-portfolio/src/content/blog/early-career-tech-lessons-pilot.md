I'm starting something new to take the razor sharp edge off of job hunting.

## What is this?

I'm going to reveal things that I think are important for anyone starting their career in tech, along with my takeaways from said things.

- These are things that people in the industry will either tell you in a roundabout way or won't tell you about at all.
- I don't know everything yet. This series will progress at an inconsistent rate as I find out more about these things.

By the way, by "tech industry" I mean a heavy emphasis on software engineering and adjacent careers (PM, solution engineer, forward deployed engineer, etc.), but some of these lessons will be applicable to hardware engineering (think something like FPGA, CPU design, embedded systems, etc.) and other industries in general.

## Who is this for?

- Anyone who is just starting their career in the tech industry (mainly SWEs and PMs).
  - Current students (high school, college, or university)
  - Recent graduates who are job hunting
  - Junior engineers
  - Experienced engineers who might find a younger person's takes amusing or insightful

## What to Expect?

Blog posts whenever I have an epiphany or learn something new that either unspoken or isn't common knowledge.

- Don't expect any particular schedule - I'll only post when I think a single lesson is substantial or a collection of lessons are ready to be shared.
