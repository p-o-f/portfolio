Welcome to my blog! 🎉

This is where I'll share career insights, including projects I'm working on, things I'm learning, and random thoughts along the way.

## Why I Started This Blog

Building in public is necessary these days, and all cracked devs have portfolio websites (and many of them have blogs).

Also, this was my first ever experience with Opus 4.5 - I was avoiding using it because it needed a paid plan on the actual claude website, but I just found out I have some free access with Antigravity. In hindsight, I should have picked a more complex task to test it out to get the wow factor. I have been using Gemini 3 Pro for a while now, and it's great, but all of social media is super hyped about Opus so I had to try it out.

## What to Expect

Here's what you might find here:

- **Dev logs** – Updates on projects I'm building
- **Tutorials** – Things I figured out and want to share
- **Thoughts** – Random musings on tech, productivity, or other lessons I'll have learned from my career

## Let's Connect

Feel free to reach out if you want to chat about anything I post here. I'm always happy to connect with fellow developers and curious minds.

Thanks for reading!
