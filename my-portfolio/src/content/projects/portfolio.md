This is the portfolio website you are currently viewing!
Everything is still being updated, so past and current projects are not going to be up to date (hopefully this changes by the end of February 2026).

## Overview

I built this site to have a central place to showcase my work and thoughts. It's designed to be fast, minimal, and easy to maintain.

- I didn't want React, fancy animations, or too much maintenance.
- The initial version went live on Vercel after less than 2 hours, thanks to Claude Opus 4.5 doing most of the work (it was my first time using Opus).
- I then purchased the domain the next day for $10/year from Spaceship (for some reason Vercel gave me a default domain which was ugly).

## Tech Stack

- **Astro**: For static site generation and excellent performance.
- **TypeScript**: For type safety and better developer experience.
- **Vanilla CSS**: For custom styling without the overhead of heavy frameworks.
- **Markdown/Content Collections**: For easy content management of projects and blog posts.
- **Vercel**: For hosting and deployment, and easy integration with GitHub (push --> deploy is basically instant).

## Features

- **Projects Section**: Automatically organized into "Currently Working On" and "Past Projects".
- **Blog Support**: Ability to write and publish articles in Markdown.
- **Responsive Design**: Looks good on all devices.
