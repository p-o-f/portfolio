ShareYT is a browser extension that makes sharing YouTube videos with friends easy and social.

## The Problem

YouTube's native sharing feels disconnected. You share a link, your friend watches it later (maybe), and there's no sense of watching things together.

## The Solution

ShareYT adds a social layer to YouTube:

- **Friend system** – Connect with people you actually want to share videos with
- **Easy sharing** – One-click share right from the YouTube page
- **Feed** – See what your friends are sharing in real-time
- **Notifications** – Get notified when friends share something you might like

## Tech Stack

- JavaScript browser extension (Chrome/Firefox)
- Firebase for backend (Auth, Firestore, Functions)
- Vanilla CSS for styling

## What I Learned

Building this taught me a lot about:

- Content scripts and browser extension architecture
- Firebase security rules and cost optimization
- Building for multiple browsers
