## Vercel Web Analytics Implementation for Astro

Successfully installed and configured Vercel Web Analytics for the Astro portfolio project.

### Changes Made

#### 1. Package Installation
- Installed `@vercel/analytics` package (version 1.6.1)
- Updated `package.json` and `package-lock.json` with the new dependency
- Version 1.6.1 exceeds the minimum required version of 1.4.0

#### 2. Layout Component Update
- Modified `src/layouts/BaseLayout.astro` (the main base layout for the project)
- Added import statement: `import Analytics from '@vercel/analytics/astro';`
- Added `<Analytics />` component in the `<head>` section of the HTML layout

### Implementation Details

The Analytics component was placed in the `<head>` section alongside other meta tags and stylesheets, following Astro best practices. This ensures the analytics tracking is initialized early in the page load cycle.

The implementation follows the existing code patterns in the project:
- Uses the same import style as the existing `SpeedInsights` component
- Maintains consistent code formatting and structure
- Preserves all existing functionality

### Verification

✓ Build completed successfully with no errors
✓ All 6 pages (Home, About, Projects, Projects detail, Blog, Blog detail) compiled correctly
✓ No linter or test errors introduced
✓ Package dependencies resolved without conflicts

### Route Support

Route support is automatically included with the `@vercel/analytics/astro` import, as per Vercel Analytics documentation. The component will automatically track page views for all routes in the application.
